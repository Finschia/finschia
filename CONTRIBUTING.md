# How to contribute to Finschia

First of all, thank you so much for taking your time to contribute!
It will be amazing if you could help us by doing any of the following:

- File an issue in [the issue tracker](https://github.com/Finschia/finschia/issues) to report bugs and propose new features and
  improvements.
- Ask a question by creating a new issue in [the issue tracker](https://github.com/Finschia/finschia/issues).
  - Browse [the list of previously answered questions](https://github.com/Finschia/finschia/issues?q=label%3Aquestion).
- Contribute your work by sending [a pull request](https://github.com/Finschia/finschia/pulls).

## Contributor license agreement

When you are sending a pull request and it's a non-trivial change beyond fixing typos, please sign 
the ICLA (individual contributor license agreement). Please
[contact us](mailto:dev@finschia.org) if you need the CCLA (corporate contributor license agreement).

## Code of conduct

We expect contributors to follow [our code of conduct](https://github.com/Finschia/finschia/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Commit message and Pull Request message

- Follow [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) to release note automation.
- Don't mention or link that can't accessable from public.
- Use English only. Because this project will be published to the world-wide open-source world. But no worries. We are fully aware of that most of us are not the English-native.

## Pull Requests

To accommodate review process we suggest that PRs are categorically broken up.
Ideally each PR addresses only a single issue. Additionally, as much as possible
code refactoring and cleanup should be submitted as a separate PRs from bugfixes/feature-additions.

### Process for reviewing PRs

All PRs require two Reviews before merge (except docs changes, or variable name-changes which only require one). When reviewing PRs please use the following review explanations:

- `LGTM` without an explicit approval means that the changes look good, but you haven't pulled down the code, run tests locally and thoroughly reviewed it.
- `Approval` through the GH UI means that you understand the code, documentation/spec is updated in the right places, you have pulled down and tested the code locally. In addition:
  - You must also think through anything which ought to be included but is not
  - You must think through whether any added code could be partially combined (DRYed) with existing code
  - You must think through any potential security issues or incentive-compatibility flaws introduced by the changes
  - Naming must be consistent with conventions and the rest of the codebase
  - Code must live in a reasonable location, considering dependency structures (e.g. not importing testing modules in production code, or including example code modules in production code).
  - if you approve of the PR, you are responsible for fixing any of the issues mentioned here and more
- If you sat down with the PR submitter and did a pairing review please note that in the `Approval`, or your PR comments.
- If you are only making "surface level" reviews, submit any notes as `Comments` without adding a review.

## Forking

Please note that Go requires code to live under absolute paths, which complicates forking.
While my fork lives at `https://github.com/someone/finschia`,
the code should never exist at `$GOPATH/src/github.com/someone/finschia`.
Instead, we use `git remote` to add the fork as a new remote for the original repo,
`$GOPATH/src/github.com/Finschia/finschia`, and do all the work there.

For instance, to create a fork and work on a branch of it, I would:

- Create the fork on github, using the fork button.
- Go to the original repo checked out locally (i.e. `$GOPATH/src/github.com/Finschia/finschia`)
- `git remote rename origin upstream`
- `git remote add origin git@github.com:someone/finschia.git`

Now `origin` refers to my fork and `upstream` refers to the finschia version.
So I can `git push -u origin main` to update my fork, and make pull requests to finschia from there.
Of course, replace `someone` with your git handle.

To pull in updates from the origin repo, run

- `git fetch upstream`
- `git rebase upstream/main` (or whatever branch you want)

Please don't make Pull Requests from `main`.

## Dependencies

We use [Go 1.22 Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) to manage
dependency versions.

The `main` branch of every finschia repository should just build with `go get`,
which means they should be kept up-to-date with their dependencies, so we can
get away with telling people they can just `go get` our software.

Since some dependencies are not under our control, a third party may break our
build, in which case we can fall back on `go mod tidy -v`.

## Testing

Tests can be ran by running `make test` at the top level of the finschia repository.

We expect tests to use `require` or `assert` rather than `t.Skip` or `t.Fail`,
unless there is a reason to do otherwise.
When testing a function under a variety of different inputs, we prefer to use
[table driven tests](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/TableDrivenTests).
Table driven test error messages should follow the following format
`<desc>, tc #<index>, i #<index>`.
`<desc>` is an optional short description of what's failing, `tc` is the
index within the table of the testcase that is failing, and `i` is when there
is a loop, exactly which iteration of the loop failed.
The idea is you should be able to see the
error message and figure out exactly what failed.
Here is an example check:

```go
<some table>
for tcIndex, tc := range cases {
  <some code>
  for i := 0; i < tc.numTxsToTest; i++ {
      <some code>
                        require.Equal(t, expectedTx[:32], calculatedTx[:32],
                                "First 32 bytes of the txs differed. tc #%d, i #%d", tcIndex, i)
```

## Branching Model and Release

User-facing repos should adhere to the trunk based development branching model: https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/.

Libraries need not follow the model strictly, but would be wise to.

This repo utilizes [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

### PR Targeting

Ensure that you base and target your PR on the `main` branch.

All feature additions should be targeted against `main`. Bug fixes for an outstanding release candidate
should be targeted against the release candidate branch.

### Development Procedure

- the latest state of development is on `main`
- `main` must never fail `make lint test test-race`
- `main` should not fail `make lint`
- no `--force` onto `main` (except when reverting a broken commit, which should seldom happen)
- create a development branch either on github.com/Finschia/finschia, or your fork (using `git remote add origin`)
- before submitting a pull request, begin `git rebase` on top of `main`

### Pull Merge Procedure

- ensure pull branch is rebased on `main`
- run `make test` to ensure that all tests pass
- merge pull request (We are using `squash and merge` for small features)

### Release Procedure

- Start on `main`
- Create the release candidate branch `rc/v*` (going forward known as **RC**)
  and ensure it's protected against pushing from anyone except the release
  manager/coordinator
  - **no PRs targeting this branch should be merged unless exceptional circumstances arise**
- On the `RC` branch, prepare a new version section in the `CHANGELOG.md`
  - All links must be link-ified
  - Copy the entries into a `RELEASE_CHANGELOG.md`, this is needed so the bot knows which entries to add to the release page on github.
- After all test has successfully completed, create the release branch
  (`release/vX.XX.X`) from the `RC` branch
- Create a PR to `main` to incorporate the `CHANGELOG.md` updates
- Tag the release (use `git tag -a`) and create a release in Github
- Delete the `RC` branches
