# Updating the docs

If you want to open a PR on Finschia to update the documentation, please follow the guidelines in the [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/Finschia/finschia/tree/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Docs Build Workflow

The documentation for Finschia is hosted at:

- https://docs-blockchain.line.biz

built from the files in this (`/docs`) directory for [main](https://github.com/Finschia/finschia/tree/main/docs)

## README

The [README.md](./README.md) is also the landing page for the documentation
on the website. During the Jenkins build, the current commit is added to the bottom
of the README.

## Links

**NOTE:** Strongly consider the existing links - both within this directory
and to the website docs - when moving or deleting files.

Relative links should be used nearly everywhere, having discovered and weighed the following:

### Relative

Where is the other file, relative to the current one?

- works both on GitHub and for the VuePress build
- confusing / annoying to have things like: `../../../../myfile.md`
- requires more updates when files are re-shuffled

### Absolute

Where is the other file, given the root of the repo?

- works on GitHub, doesn't work for the VuePress build
- this is much nicer: `/docs/hereitis/myfile.md`
- if you move that file around, the links inside it are preserved (but not to it, of course)

### Full

The full GitHub URL to a file or directory. Used occasionally when it makes sense
to send users to the GitHub.

## Building Locally

To build and serve the documentation locally, run:

```bash
npm install -g vuepress
```

then change the following line in the `config.js`:

```js
base: "/docs/",
```

to:

```js
base: "/",
```

Finally, go up one directory to the root of the repo and run:

```bash
# from root of repo
vuepress build docs
cd dist/docs
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
```

then navigate to localhost:8080 in your browser.
